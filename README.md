===

A Java-Prolog integration library inspired by [Google's Gson](https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide/ "Google's Gson").

JPC provides different layers of integration abstractions based on the notion of inter-language conversions.
In case you would like to know more about it, you may find interesting the JPC's [documentation](http://java-prolog-connectivity.github.com/ "JPC Documentation").
