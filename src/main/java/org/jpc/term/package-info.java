 * Most classes in this package are a thin version of the richer JPL classes reifying Prolog logic terms
 * DISCLAIMER: In the current implementation methods and most of their comments have been copied from their corresponding JPL class.
 * The objective of using this library instead of just using the JPL classes is providing a common model for expressing logic terms, 
 * that can be easily converted to alternative term models according to the requirements of the logic engine used
